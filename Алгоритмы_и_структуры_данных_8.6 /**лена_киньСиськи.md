**Introduction**

This code snippet demonstrates how to find the most frequent elements in a list of numbers. It uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each number, and then finds the maximum value in the dictionary.

**Code Explanation**

The code snippet begins by creating a list of numbers.

```python
numbers_list = [0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 98, 3, 1, 98, 7, 16, 16, 4, 0, 42]
```

Next, the code creates a dictionary to store the frequency of each number. The dictionary is initialized with all keys set to 0.

```python
frequency_dict = {}
for number in numbers_list:
    if number in frequency_dict:
        frequency_dict[number] += 1
    else:
        frequency_dict[number] = 1
```

The code then finds the maximum value in the dictionary. This is the number that occurs most frequently in the list.

```python
max_frequency = max(frequency_dict.values())
```

Finally, the code prints the number that occurs most frequently in the list.

```python
for number, frequency in frequency_dict.items():
    if frequency == max_frequency:
        print(number)
```

**Output**

The output of the code snippet is the number that occurs most frequently in the list. In this case, the output is:

```
98
```

**Conclusion**

This code snippet demonstrates how to find the most frequent elements in a list of numbers. It uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each number, and then finds the maximum value in the dictionary.
